![MAC Address](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lolouk44/xiaomi_mi_scale/master/Screenshots/MAC_Address.png)

2. Open Home Assistant and navigate to add-on store. Click on the 3 dots (top right) and select Repositories
3. Enter `https://github.com/lolouk44/hassio-addons` in the box and click on Add

5. Click on Xiaomi Mi Scale then click on Install
6. Edit the Configuration


Option | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
HCI_DEV | string | No | Bluetooth hci device to use. Defaults to hci0
BLUEPY_PASSIVE_SCAN | bool | No | Try to set to true if getting an error like `Bluetooth connection error: Failed to execute management command ‘le on’` on a Raspberry Pi. Defaults to false
MISCALE_MAC | string | Yes | Mac address of your scale
MQTT_PREFIX | string | No | MQTT Topic Prefix. Defaults to miscale
MQTT_HOST | string | Yes | MQTT Server (defaults to 127.0.0.1)
MQTT_USERNAME | string | No | Username for MQTT server (comment out if not required)
MQTT_PASSWORD | string | No | Password for MQTT (comment out if not required)
MQTT_PORT | int | No | Defaults to 1883
TIME_INTERVAL | int | No | Time in sec between each query to the scale, to allow other applications to use the Bluetooth module. Defaults to 30
MQTT_DISCOVERY | bool | No | MQTT Discovery for Home Assistant Defaults to true
MQTT_DISCOVERY_PREFIX | string | No | MQTT Discovery Prefix for Home Assistant. Defaults to homeassistant
USERS | List | Yes | List of users to add

Auto-gender selection/config -- This is used to create the calculations such as BMI, Water/Bone Mass etc...
Here is the logic used to assign a measured weight to a user:
- If the weight is within the range of a user's defined values for GT and LT, then it will be assigned (published) to that user.
- If the weight matches two separate user ranges, it will only be assigned to the first user that matched (so don't overlap ranges!)

User Option | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
GT | int | Yes | Greater Than - Weight must be greater than this value - this will be the lower limit for the weight range of this user
LT | int | Yes | Less Than - Weight must be less than this value - this will be the upper limit for the weight range of this user
SEX | string | Yes | male / female
NAME | string | Yes | Name of the user
HEIGHT | int | Yes | Height (in cm) of the user
DOB | string | Yes | DOB (in yyyy-mm-dd format)

Note: The weight definitions must be in the same unit as the scale (kg, Lbs, jin)

7. Start the add-on


## Home-Assistant Setup:
Under the `sensor` block, enter as many blocks as users configured in your environment variables:
(Note: only weight entities are automatically added via the MQTT Discovery)

```yaml
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Example Name Weight"
    state_topic: "miscale/USER_NAME/weight"
    value_template: "{{ value_json['weight'] }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "kg"
    json_attributes_topic: "miscale/USER_NAME/weight"
    icon: mdi:scale-bathroom

  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Example Name BMI"
    state_topic: "miscale/USER_NAME/weight"
    value_template: "{{ value_json['bmi'] }}"
    icon: mdi:human-pregnant
    unit_of_measurement: "kg/m2"

```
