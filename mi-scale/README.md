Auto-gender selection/config -- This is used to create the calculations such as BMI, Water/Bone Mass etc...
Up to 3 users possible as long as weights do not overlap!
Here is the logic used to assign a measured weight to a user:
```
if [measured value] is greater than USER1_GT, assign it to USER1
else if [measured value] is less than USER2_LT, assign it to USER2
else assign it to USER3 (e.g. USER2_LT < [measured value] < USER1_GT)
```

Option | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
USER1_GT | int | Yes | If the weight is greater than this number, we'll assume that we're weighing User #1
USER1_SEX | string | Yes | male / female
USER1_NAME | string | Yes | Name of the user
USER1_HEIGHT | int | Yes | Height (in cm) of the user
USER1_DOB | string | Yes | DOB (in yyyy-mm-dd format)
USER2_LT | int | No | If the weight is less than this number, we'll assume that we're weighing User #2. Defaults to USER1_GT Value
USER2_SEX | string | No | male / female. Defaults to female
USER2_NAME | string | No | Name of the user. Defaults to Serena
USER2_HEIGHT | int | No |Height (in cm) of the user. Defaults to 95
USER2_DOB | string | No | DOB (in yyyy-mm-dd format). Defaults to 1990-01-01
USER3_SEX | string | No | male / female. Defaults to female
USER3_NAME | string | No | Name of the user. Defaults to Missy
USER3_HEIGHT | int | No |Height (in cm) of the user. Defaults to 150
USER3_DOB | string | No | DOB (in yyyy-mm-dd format). Defaults to 1990-01-01


7. Start the add-on


## Home-Assistant Setup:
Under the `sensor` block, enter as many blocks as users configured in your environment variables:
(Note: only weight entities are automatically added via the MQTT Discovery)

```yaml
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Example Name Weight"
    state_topic: "miscale/USER_NAME/weight"
    value_template: "{{ value_json['weight'] }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "kg"
    json_attributes_topic: "miscale/USER_NAME/weight"
    icon: mdi:scale-bathroom

  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Example Name BMI"
    state_topic: "miscale/USER_NAME/weight"
    value_template: "{{ value_json['bmi'] }}"
    icon: mdi:human-pregnant
    unit_of_measurement: "kg/m2"

```
